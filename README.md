# Create a project scaffold

Create development environment that is cloud-based:

### Colab Notebook

* Integrates very deeply into GitHub, so we can start building cloud-based solutions very quickly.
This is an example of how to use [colab](https://github.com/twolf789/python-devops/blob/main/getting_started_python.ipynb)

### GitHub Codespaces

Build out Python project scaffold:

* Makefile - it keeps track of very complex things, so that we would be able to reproduce them at will.
* requirements.txt
* test_library.py
* python_library.py
* Dockerfile
* command-line-tool
* Microservice

1. Create a virtualenv: `virtualenv ~/.venv`
2. edit my '~/.bashrc' : `source ~/.venv/Scripts/activate`
